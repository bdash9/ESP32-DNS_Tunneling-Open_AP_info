ESP32 Tunnling AP info data out via DNS

Origional code from MDP:

https://github.com/mdp/ESP32_DNS_Tracker/tree/main

There are two parts to the code. Firast is the ESP32 scanning for Access points (wifi). Identifying the open access points and then sending the list of AP's, encoded in hex) to a remote DNS server that can decode the dns record requests.

I made very few modifications to the above code. Added some lines to work with my Adafruit esp32 Feather TFT and renamed a function.
